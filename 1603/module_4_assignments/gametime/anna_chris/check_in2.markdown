## Next Steps?

- What do you feel the next steps should be?

  * Add functionality so that ship can shoot
  * Handle asteroid/bullet collisions
  * Add tests for asteroid functions
  * Make game consist of more than 1 ship
  * Add scoring

### General Questions, Comments, Concerns?
  * Discussion of refactoring strategies would be helpful, especially re: asteroid functions/setup as we will need to identify/change specific asteroids
